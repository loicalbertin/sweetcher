# First lets define our proxies
proxies:
  main: "https://masterproxy.yourcompany.it:8080"
  hidden: "http://hiddenproxy.yourcompany.it"
  custom: "socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"

# Then lets define some profiles
profiles:
  atCompany:
    # A profile should have a default proxy if none of its rules match
    default: main
    # Rules are ordered
    rules:
      - host_wildcard: "gist.github.com"
        proxy: hidden
      - host_wildcard: "*.yourcompany.it"
        # direct is a reserved word that means: "forward the request directly to the targeted site without using a proxy"
        proxy: direct
      - host_wildcard: "*.google.*"
        proxy: hidden
      - host_wildcard: "*.reedit.*"
        proxy: hidden
  homeworking:
    default: direct
    rules:
      - host_wildcard: "someplace.yourcompany.it"
        proxy: hidden

# Finally lets set the current profile
server:
  profile: atCompany
  # setup the listening address
  address: "127.0.0.1:8080"
